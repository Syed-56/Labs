Q1. Which Jump instructions follow signed integer comparison and which follow unsigned integer comparison?
Ans: unsigned comparison only use ZF,CF and not use SF,OF but signed comparison uses SF,OF
	unsigned jumps: JB,JA,JBE,JAE,JE,JNE.	signed jumps: JL,JG,JLE,JGE,JE,JNE
Q2. Which conditional jump instruction branches based on the contents of ECX?
Ans: LOOP, LOOPE, LOOPNE, LOOPZ, LOOPNZ
Q3. The destination label of a LOOPZ instruction is? Ans: -128 to 127 bytes
Q4. Convert into assembly:-
if( ebx > ecx AND ebx > edx) OR ( edx > eax ) 
 X = 1
else
 X = 2

checkAnd:
CMP EBX, ECX
JNG checkOr
CMP EBX,EDX
JNG checkOr

check Or:
CMP EDX, EAX
JNG elseBlock

MOV X,1
JMP done

elseBlock:
MOV X,2
