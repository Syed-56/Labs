Q1. Write a single instruction using 16-bit operands that clears the high 8 bits of AX and does not change the low 8 bits.
Ans: AND AX, 0000000011111111
Q2. Write a single instruction using 16-bit operands that sets the high 8 bits of AX and does not change the low 8 bits.
Ans: OR AX, 11111111100000000
Q3. Write a single instruction (other than NOT) that inverts all the bits in EAX.
Ans: XOR EAX, 11111111111111111111111111111111
Q4. Write instructions that set the Zero flag if the 32-bit value in EAX is even and clear the Zero flag if EAX is odd.
Ans: Divide number by 2 and compare EDX,0. ZF will automatically be set or cleared. You can then use JZ and JNZ to print respective statements.
Q5. Give Uppercase <-> Lowercase conversion instructions:
Ans: uppercase to lowercase -> OR AL, 00100000
     lower to upper -> AND AL, 11011111
Q6. Give binary <-> ASCII conversion instructions:
Ans: binary to ascii -> OR AL, 30h
     ascii to binary -> SUB AL, 30h
