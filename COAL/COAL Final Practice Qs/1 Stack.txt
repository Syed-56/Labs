Q1. Which Register in Protected mode manages stack?
Ans: ESP points to top of stack and SS defines which segment used as stack.

Q2. How is the runtime stack different from the stack abstract data type?
Ans: Stack ADT is a theoretical concept used to simulate a data structure with push,pop,peek,empty operations. Meanwhile runtime stack is used for managing function calls and is dependant on hardware.

Q3. Why stack is called LIFO
Ans: Because last inserted elements are popped out first.

Q4. When a 32-bit value is pushed on the stack, what happens to ESP?
Ans: ESP is decremented by 4h: if ESP=1000h then 1000h-4h = 0FFCh is new ESP

Q9. Which instruction pushes all of the 32-bit general-purpose registers on the stack? Ans: PUSHAD
Q10. Which instruction pushes the 32-bit EFLAGS register on the stack? Ans: PUSHFD
Q11. Which instruction pops the stack into the EFLAGS register? Ans: POPFD
Q12. What happens when a 8 or 16 bit value is pushed on 32 bit stack? Ans: The value is zero extended.

Q13. Suppose there were no PUSH instruction. Write a sequence of two other instructions that would accomplish the same as PUSH EAX?
Ans: since push decrements ESP by 4h and makes ESP equal to pushed value so we would do:
SUB ESP, 4h
MOV [ESP], EAX
